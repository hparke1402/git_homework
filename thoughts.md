Spending just a little bit of time with the material before class helps me not feel as lost. I don't understand the material when I review it at first but it's good to expose myself to the concepts so I don't feel as lost during instruction.
I am going to make a ton of mistakes (already have made countless errors!) while learning these new programs and systems, but learning what NOT to do and why is very valuable as a beginner.
